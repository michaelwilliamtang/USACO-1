## Introduction

In competitive programming contests, one must solve well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified constraints ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)). Typically, the most popular language is C++, followed by Java and Python.

## Notes

I am currently not updating the following pages:

 * README's for most implementations
 * tables and solutions for non-platinum USACO contests

If you would like to contribute, provide feedback, or encourage me to update something, please email me at *bqi343@gmail.com* or submit a pull request. If you have a question, it may be answered by another file in this folder.

## Getting Started

I recommend that you use C++, even if you already know some other language such as Java or Python (see "resources"). A solid foundation in math (ex. AIME qualification) can help greatly.

Assuming you know how C++ input/output works, you should soon be able to advance from USACO Bronze. Easier contests such as [AtCoder Beginner](http://atcoder.jp/) and CodeForces Div. 3 may be helpful. 

## General Tips

 * Do as many (high-quality) contests as possible.
   * Make sure to [upsolve](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upsolve) after the contest ends!
 * Work through past problems (see "Resources.md" and the README in "Contests.")
 * Use the tags to learn new topics as necessary.
